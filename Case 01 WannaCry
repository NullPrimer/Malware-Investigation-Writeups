- My Custom Yara Rule for hunting WannaCry

This ransomware utilizes a hybrid cryptographic model in which it combines an asymmetric cryptography with a symmetric cryptography.

Wannacry uses the follwing API's to achive this.

- CryptGenKey is used to generate RSA key pair. 
- CryptEncrypt is used for encrypting the files using the symmetric key - AES in this case 
- CryptImportKey is for importing the Attackerâ€™s public key (APU) 
- CryptExportKey is used for exporting the AES keys that are encrypted using the VPU 
- CryptDestroyKey is to destroy the memory area where the key was held in such a way that the key can never be recovered
- EncryptFileA is used to encrypt a file or directory.
- DecryptFileA is used to decrypt an encrypted file or directory.
- EnumSystemLocalesA is used enumerate installed locale identifiers, all of the supported identifiers or alternate sort identifiers, according to which flag is passed to the API. 
Can be used to geofence infection campaigns or avoid infecting systems from a certain region/country. 
It can also be used to jump to allocated shellcode and execute it.
